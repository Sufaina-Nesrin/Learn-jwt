for those who dont understand the app.post('/api/refresh);

first you should know why its using , what is the use case of creating new token as many times
when your token will be stolen, it is dangerous and others can easily authorize in you account 
for avoid this we are creating new tokens in many times

how its happening
here is the brief explanation

1.when we login using app.post("/api/login) with our user playload means user information
we are creating new access token with expiresIn 15s ,at the same time we also creating 
a refreshToken with another secretKey and same playload
and push it into an array called  refreshTokens

and also send accessToken and refreshToken in res

this is what happening in the /api/login calling

what's next>>>

2.when we called app.post('/api/refresh')

we should pass the refreshToken that sent through res in req.body
then there is condition to check is there any req.body and return res of you are not authenticated

then check the corresponding req.body.token is in there that array that we have mentioned earlier
int the login section
if not return the res of Refresh token is invalid

else ,we call the verify method with parameteres of refreshToken and the secretKey
if error console the err and return res of refreshkey is not valid

else we get new accessToken and new refreshToken ,same as created earlier,
and also we just exclude the old refreshToken from the array and also push the newRefreshToken to the array

so that, when next time when we authorize with the old refreshkey it reject witht refresh token is invalid
and we should use newly created refreshToken

cool right?
